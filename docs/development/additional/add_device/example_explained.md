# Device Addition - Example Explained

This script guides the reader through the implementation of one of the device files in flowchem.

To better understand how the package works, let's select a device consisiting of multiple components: the ML600.

The ML600 is a syringe pump developed by 
[Hamilton Company](https://www.hamiltoncompany.com/laboratory-products/microlab-600/stand-alone-syringe-pumps).

There are two models of these pumps, one with a single channel and one with two channels, as shown in the figure above:

![](example.JPG)

As we can see, one channel consists of a valve connected to the outlet of the syringe. It means that this device has more than one 
component, i.e, valve and pump.

Let's start with the basics, as we learned in [add_new_device](add_to_flowchem.md).

First, we will create the script where the ML600's device class will be written. Let's call it `ml600.py`:

```python
from flowchem.components.device_info import DeviceInfo
from flowchem.devices.flowchem_device import FlowchemDevice
from flowchem.devices.hamilton.ml600_pump import ML600Pump              # Component - Pump
from flowchem.devices.hamilton.ml600_valve import ML600LeftValve        # Component - Valve


class ML600(FlowchemDevice):

    def __init__(
        self,
        name: str,
    ) -> None:
        
        super().__init__(name)
        
        self.device_info = DeviceInfo(
            manufacturer="Hamilton",
            model="ML600",
        )

    async def initialize(self):
        """Initialize pump and its components."""

        self.components.extend([ML600Pump("pump", self), ML600LeftValve("valve", self)])
```

We will write a new module in the same folder with the classes for each component. The pump component, for 
example, we have the `ml600_pump.py`.

```python
from flowchem.components.pumps.syringe_pump import SyringePump
from typing import TYPE_CHECKING
if TYPE_CHECKING:
    from .ml600 import ML600

class ML600Pump(SyringePump):
    
    pump_code: str
    hw_device: ML600  # for typing's sake

    def __init__(self, name: str, hw_device: ML600, pump_code: str = "") -> None:
        
        super().__init__(name, hw_device)

    @staticmethod
    def is_withdrawing_capable() -> bool:
        """
        Indicate that the ML600 pump can perform withdrawal operations.
        """
        return True

    async def is_pumping(self) -> bool:
        """
        Check if the pump is currently moving.

        Returns:
        --------
        bool
            True if the pump is moving or has commands in buffer, False if it's idle.
        """
        ...

    async def stop(self) -> bool:
        """
        Stop the pump's operation.

        Returns:
        --------
        bool
            True if the pump successfully stops, False otherwise.
        """
        ...

    async def infuse(self, rate: str = "", volume: str = "") -> bool:
        """
        Start an infusion with the given rate and volume.
        """
        ...

    async def withdraw(self, rate: str = "1 ml/min", volume: str | None = None) -> bool:
        """
        Start a withdrawal with the given rate and volume.
        """
        ...
```

Observe that the pump component of the device is a syringe pump, which means that we can inherit the functionality 
of the SyringePump class. We just need to overwrite the methods according to our specific connectivity commands from 
the device.

It is a good practice to access the methods of our main class, where the connectivity is built. For example:

```python
...
from flowchem import ureg    
...
class ML600Pump(SyringePump):
    def __init__(self, name: str, hw_device: ML600, pump_code: str = "") -> None:
        super().__init__(name, hw_device)
        self.pump_code = pump_code      
                                         
    async def is_pumping(self) -> bool:
        """ ... """
        return await self.hw_device.get_pump_status(self.pump_code)
    
    async def stop(self) -> bool:
        """ ... """
        await self.hw_device.stop(self.pump_code)
        return not await self.hw_device.get_pump_status(self.pump_code)
    
    async def infuse(self, rate: str = "", volume: str = "") -> bool:
        """ ... """
        current_volume = await self.hw_device.get_current_volume(self.pump_code)
        target_vol = current_volume - ureg.Quantity(volume)
        await self.hw_device.set_to_volume(target_vol, ureg.Quantity(rate), self.pump_code)
        return await self.hw_device.get_pump_status(self.pump_code)
    
    async def withdraw(self, rate: str = "1 ml/min", volume: str | None = None) -> bool:
        """ ... """
        current_volume = await self.hw_device.get_current_volume(self.pump_code)
        target_vol = current_volume + ureg.Quantity(volume)
        await self.hw_device.set_to_volume(target_vol, ureg.Quantity(rate), self.pump_code)
        return await self.hw_device.get_pump_status(self.pump_code)
```

```{note}
The `pump_code` attribute is specific for each device. It is used to identify a particular device, since to one serial port,
multiple devices can be connected in form of a daisy chain. This allows us to send commands to the correct device
```
The communication with the device happens inside the methods `get_pump_status`, `set_to_volume`, and `stop` of the `hw_device`. 
Remember that the `hw_device` is the ML600 main class.

Now, let`s come back to our main class. With a careful look at the device 
[manual](../../../user-guides/reference/devices/pumps/ml600.pdf) we will see how the commands should be written and 
sent through the serial. Based on this, we can write a data class to help us manage it all.

```python
import string
...
PUMP_ADDRESS = dict(enumerate(string.ascii_lowercase[:16], start=1))
...
@dataclass
class Protocol1Command:
    """Class representing a pump command and its expected reply."""

    command: str
    target_pump_num: int = 1
    target_component: str = ""
    command_value: str = ""
    optional_parameter: str = ""
    parameter_value: str = ""
    execution_command: str = "R"  # Execute

    def compile(self) -> str:
        """Create actual command byte by prepending pump address to command and appending executing command."""
        compiled_command = (
            f"{PUMP_ADDRESS[self.target_pump_num]}"
            f"{self.target_component}"
            f"{self.command}{self.command_value}"
        )

        if self.parameter_value:
            compiled_command += f"{self.optional_parameter}{self.parameter_value}"

        return compiled_command + self.execution_command
```

The commands can be grouped in an Enum, effectively managing the commands sent to the device:

```python
...
class ML600Commands(Enum):
    """ Just a collection of commands. Grouped here to ease future, unlikely, changes. """

    PAUSE = "K"
    RESUME = "$"
    CLEAR_BUFFER = "V"

    INIT_ALL = "X"
    INIT_VALVE_ONLY = "LX"
    INIT_SYRINGE_ONLY = "X1"

    # only works for pumps with two syringe drivers
    SET_VALVE_CONTINUOUS_DISPENSE = "LST19"
    SET_VALVE_DUAL_DILUTOR = "LST20"

    # if there are two drivers, both sides can be selected
    SELECT_LEFT = "B"
    SELECT_RIGHT = "C"

    # SYRINGE POSITION
    PICKUP = "P"
    DELIVER = "D"
    ABSOLUTE_MOVE = "M"

    # STATUS REQUEST
    # INFORMATION REQUEST -- these all returns Y/N/* where * means busy
    REQUEST_DONE = "F"
    SYRINGE_HAS_ERROR = "Z"
    VALVE_HAS_ERROR = "G"
    IS_SINGLE_SYRINGE = "H"
    # STATUS REQUEST  - these have complex responses, see relevant methods for details.
    STATUS_REQUEST = "E1"
    ERROR_REQUEST = "E2"
    TIMER_REQUEST = "E3"
    BUSY_STATUS = "T1"
    ERROR_STATUS = "T2"
    # PARAMETER REQUEST
    SYRINGE_DEFAULT_SPEED = "YQS"
      # 2-3692 seconds per stroke
    CURRENT_SYRINGE_POSITION = "YQP"  # 0-52800 steps
    SYRINGE_DEFAULT_BACKOFF = "YQB"  # 0-1000 steps
    CURRENT_VALVE_POSITION = "LQP"
      # 1-8 (see docs, Table 3.2.2
    GET_RETURN_STEPS = "YQN"  # 0-1000 steps
    # PARAMETER CHANGE
    SET_RETURN_STEPS = "YSN"  # 0-1000
    # VALVE REQUEST
    VALVE_ANGLE = "LQA"  # 0-359 degrees
    VALVE_CONFIGURATION = "YQS"
      # 11-20 (see docs, Table 3.2.2
    ...
```

And finally, a class to setup up the serial connection, which can control a series of devices 
through the same port:

```python
class HamiltonPumpIO:
    """Setup with serial parameters, low level IO."""

    ACKNOWLEDGE = chr(6)
    NEGATIVE_ACKNOWLEDGE = chr(21)
    DEFAULT_CONFIG = {
        "timeout": 0.1,
        "baudrate": 9600,
        "parity": aioserial.PARITY_ODD,
        "stopbits": aioserial.STOPBITS_ONE,
        "bytesize": aioserial.SEVENBITS,
    }

    def __init__(self, aio_port: aioserial.Serial) -> None:
        """Initialize serial port, not pumps."""
        self._serial = aio_port
        self.num_pump_connected: int | None = (
            None  # Set by `HamiltonPumpIO.initialize()`
        )
    ...

    async def _write_async(self, command: bytes):
        """Write a command to the pump."""
        await self._serial.write_async(command)

    async def _read_reply_async(self) -> str:
        """Read the pump reply from serial communication."""
        reply_string = await self._serial.readline_async()
        return reply_string.decode("ascii")

    async def write_and_read_reply_async(self, command: Protocol1Command) -> str:
        """Send a command to the pump, read the replies and returns it, optionally parsed."""
        self._serial.reset_input_buffer()
        await self._write_async(f"{command.compile()}\r".encode("ascii"))
        response = await self._read_reply_async()

        return self._parse_response(response)
```

The methods whiten in the component class to access the functionality of the device are built in the main class of 
the device:

The example above shows how devices can be added to the flowchem package. Additional functionality 
can be added by following provided outline.

To better understand the information flow in this class, consider the scenario where an infuse command is sent to the 
pump, as illustrated below.

![](command_flow.JPG)

The infuse command is directed to the `set_to_volume` method in the `ML600` class. The volume and flowrate is translated to the 
device and syringe size specific plunger speed and position. The command and parameters are packed in `Protocol1Command` class.
The actual command string is constructed in `HamiltonPumpIO` by calling `Protocol1Command.compile` and written to the serial port.

The code for implementing the ml600 is provided **here**.
