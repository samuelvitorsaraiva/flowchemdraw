Vacuubrand CVC3000
==================

## Introduction
Vacuubrand CVC3000 pressure controllers can be controlled via a serial (RS-232) interface.
Note that even when the CVC3000 controller is embedded in a pump module, the serial port on the back can still be
accessed via the bottom of the pump.

```{note}
The Serial connection parameters can be set on the controller to different values.
To establish connection it is crucial that the settings on the controller match the parameters provided in the
configuration file.
As default, the following configuration is used:
* baudrate 19200
* parity none
* stopbits 1
* bytesize 8
```
